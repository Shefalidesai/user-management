# User Management System - Angular 14

This project is a simple user management system built using **Angular 14** and **Angular Material**. It includes functionalities such as displaying users, adding, editing, deleting users, pagination, role management, and more. The application uses **local storage** for data persistence.

## Features

- **User List**: Displays a list of users with their name, email, and role.
- **Add User**: Add a new user to the system with fields for name, email, and role.
- **Edit User**: Edit existing user details.
- **Delete User**: Delete users from the list with a confirmation dialog.
- **Role Management**: Assign roles (Admin/User) to users.
- **Search**: Search users by name or email.
- **Pagination**: Display users in pages, 10 users per page.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

1. **Node.js**: The current LTS version of Node.js can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Angular CLI**: Install Angular CLI globally by running the following command:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @angular/cli
   ```

3. **Git**: Make sure Git is installed to clone the repository.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/user-management-angular.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd user-management-angular
```

Then, install the required dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages, including Angular Material and other dependencies.

### 3. Serve the Application

To run the application in development mode, use the following command:

```bash
ng serve
```

This will start the development server. The application will be accessible in your browser at:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

### 4. Build the Application

To build the project for production, use the following command:

```bash
ng build --prod
```

This will generate a `dist/` folder with optimized files that can be deployed to a web server. The build will be in production mode, which includes optimizations such as minification and tree-shaking.

### 5. Run Unit Tests

To run unit tests with Karma, use:

```bash
ng test
```

This will run the tests in the background and show the results in the terminal.

### 6. Run End-to-End Tests

To run end-to-end tests with Protractor, use:

```bash
ng e2e
```

This will execute the e2e tests.

## Angular Material

This project uses Angular Material for UI components. The following modules are imported in the `app.module.ts` file:

- **MatDialogModule**: For opening dialogs.
- **MatTableModule**: For displaying the user table.

## Local Storage

The application uses **local storage** to persist user data. It retrieves the list of users from `localStorage` and allows adding, editing, and deleting users directly in the local storage.

### User Service

The `UserService` provides methods for managing the users:

- **getUsers()**: Fetches the list of users from local storage.
- **addUser(user: User)**: Adds a new user to local storage.
- **updateUser(user: User)**: Updates an existing user.
- **deleteUser(email: string)**: Deletes a user by email.
